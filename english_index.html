                <img src="imgs/fba_menu.png" alt="A Fireball Arena menüje." >
                <p>During the project, we developed a multiplayer "Bomberman"-style game in Java, where two players compete against each other on a 2D grid. Players can place bombs that explode to remove obstacles and opponents. The project was completed as a team effort, and we successfully incorporated several power-ups, such as increasing the bomb's range, as well as monsters that hinder the players. The final game also includes a local multiplayer feature.</p>
