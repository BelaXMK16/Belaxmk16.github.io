                <h1>Java Group Project: Bomberman (Fireball Arena)</h1> 
                <p>In this project, we developed a multiplayer "Bomberman"-style game in Java, where two players compete on a 2D map. Players can place bombs, which explode and remove obstacles and enemies. The project was completed as a team effort, and we managed to implement several bonuses, such as increasing bomb range, as well as monsters that hinder the players. The game also features local multiplayer functionality.</p>
